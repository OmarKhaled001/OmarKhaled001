## 🚀 What I Do

I build robust backend systems and intuitive admin interfaces for complex business workflows. My work centers on Laravel and Filament PHP, where I've developed solutions across ERP, POS, CRM, and multi-tenant architectures.

My approach combines technical depth with business understanding—I don't just write code, I solve problems. Whether it's optimizing database performance, designing clean APIs, or implementing complex business logic, I deliver systems that scale.
